        introduction:
          "Cryptocurrency has opened the doors to unprecedented financial opportunities, but it has also unleashed a wave of scams. According to industry reports, billions of dollars have been lost to rug pulls, honeypots, fake liquidity pools, and scam tokens in just the last two years. With thousands of new tokens launched daily on blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), how can retail traders and investors protect themselves? This is where Coinguard comes in. So, what is Coinguard? Coinguard is an AI-powered Web3 and blockchain security suite that helps users scan tokens, detect scams, monitor wallets, and trade more safely. It combines multiple security tools — token scan, rug check, honeypot detector, liquidity scan, wallet tracker, AI chat assistant, and NFT generator — into one integrated platform.",
