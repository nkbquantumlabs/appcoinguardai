        introduction:
          "Walk the fortress of DeFi if you dare—a vast citadel built over seas of shimmering tokens, radiant and inviting. From a distance, every gate gleams gold. Every wall looks secure. But step closer, and the shimmer may hide traps: unlocked liquidity, greedy dev hands, ghost volume, and pools so shallow they crack under pressure.\n" + 
          " In this fortress, one tool pierces the facade—Coinguard Liquidity Scan—casting light through locked gates and illuminating the shadowed passageways of risk so that traders may see, decide, and survive.",

        name: "The Quiet Threat Behind the Walls",
        paragraph:
          "Liquidity should be a promise: when you buy, you can one day sell. But many gates in the fortress are false. Developers hold the keys but slip them away. Liquidity that was supposed to be locked disappears. Ownership becomes opaque. Flashy metrics draw you in. Then the cracks show.\n" +
          "Traders across Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Polygon, and others face this unseen sabotage. Pools appear deep but betray under volume. Liquidity is unlocked, allowing sudden withdrawals. Majority ownership in few hands means exit without warning. These are the perils Coinguard Liquidity Scan was built to expose.\n",
                },

        name: "Walls, Gates & Guardians: Features That Secure the Keep",
        paragraph:
          "Just like ancient fortifications, the fortress needs guards, locks, and watchers. Coinguard Liquidity Scan provides the architecture with:\n" +
          "1. Liquidity Lock Detection – It verifies if liquidity is secured under lock contracts; if those gates are sealed or free to swing open.\n" +
          "2. Ownership Transparency – Who holds the keys? If a single wallet or a small clique controls most of the liquidity, that gate is weak.\n" +
          "3. Pool Depth & Real-Liquidity Analysis – Checks whether the pool is truly deep enough to permit real trade, or merely an illusion of safety.\n" +
          "4. AI-Powered Risk Signals – Safe, Warning, Danger —simple visual signals so traders can act fast, without deciphering raw code.\n" +
          "5. Cross-Chain Coverage – Works across major networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and more. So wherever the fortress appears, you can scan.\n",
      },
      {
        name: "How Traders Traverse the Fortress",
        paragraph:
          "Armed with Coinguard Liquidity Scan, here’s how the journey goes:\n" +
          "1. Connect your wallet securely.\n" +
          "2. Input the token’s contract address or search by name.\n" +
          "3. Activate the Liquidity Scan → observe locked/unlocked status, ownership concentration, pool depth.\n"+
          "4. Read the risk signal: safe if locked, deep, and transparent; warning if some gates are weak; danger if many red flags.\n"+
          "5. Only then, decide: step forward, retreat, or circle the wall until you’re sure.\n"+
          "For many, this transforms risky leaps into measured steps. It’s the difference between walking blind through the Fortress or navigating by light.\n",
      },
      {
        name: "Why It Matters",
        paragraph:
          "New tokens often launch with hype—flashy websites, social buzz, promise of returns. But when liquidity is weak or under developer control, that promise is empty. Traders get trapped by doors that lock behind them or pools that drain to dust.\n"+
          "Coinguard Liquidity Scan is more than just a tool—it’s your siege engine in the fortress. It helps you spot faulty gates before you try to pass through them, see if the path is supported, and avoid being caught in collapsing walls. With it, you trade not with fear, but with knowledge and strength." ,

          "The room was silent except for the steady hum of Raj’s laptop. It was 2:00 AM, and while the world slept, the crypto markets were alive. A new token was trending—posts shouting “100x returns overnight!” filled his feed. Raj leaned forward, his heart racing. He imagined paying off debts, buying a sleek new car, even quitting his job. The temptation was too strong. But deep inside, a flicker of doubt rose. Just last week, his best friend lost $5,000 in a honeypot scam. The cruel setup was simple: you could buy the token, but you could never sell it. It was a trap disguised as opportunity. Raj’s finger hovered over the “Buy” button.
